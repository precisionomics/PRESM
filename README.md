PRESM user’s manual
PRESM stands for Personal Reference Editor for Somatic Mutation discovery. Compared with other reference genome editor software which apply diploid reference genome to improve read mapping accuracy, PRESM provides two haploid reference genomes. The pipeline of PRESM involves three steps: Firstly, germline mutations are discovered by another tool, e.g., GATK, and are used to make personalized references to call somatic mutations. Secondly, a reference genome composed of all personal variants (including both heterozygous and homozygous sites) is used as “decoy” to capture the heterozygous variants in reads. Thirdly, PRESM changes the reads by replacing all heterozygous alleles with the corresponding reference alleles and maps the modified reads back to another personalized reference genome that contains only homozygous changes. The output of this step is a BAM file ready for any somatic mutation callers to use. We intend to offer long-term maintenance for PRESM and continue adding our new functions into it.
1.	INSTALLATION
The PRESM is a batteries-included executable, therefore no installion is needed. Just copy the executable presm.jar and run it using the standard command for java package:
java –jar presm.jar
2.	Functions
1.	Processing variant call files generated by GATK, Pindel or other variant call software, i.e., combining two variant call files; homozygous variants or heterozygous variants selecting; variants deduplication.
2.	Generating the personalized reference genome according to the germline mutations provided by the users.
3.	Generating the personalized vcf files according to the germline mutations provided by the users, for example, the personalized dbsnp.vcf, db.indel.vcf, cosmic.vcf should be generated before the somatic mutation calling procedure of the current methods.
4.	Mapping the somatic variants called using personalized reference genome to the universal reference genome.
5.	Replacing the alternative alleles with reference bases according to the heterozygous variants provided by the users.
