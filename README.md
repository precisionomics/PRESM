# OCMA

OCMA Userâ€™s Manual r0.1
July 17, 2018

OCMA factorizes very large matrices using disk-based out-of-core technology and Intel Math Kernel Library (Intel MKL), and it adopts the technology of memory-mapped file I/O.

### Installation

After downloading, the users will see two files: ocma-0.1.zip is for Windows system ocma-0.1.tar.gzis for Linux/Unix system.
After decompression, one will see two folders: src and bin. The folder src contains all the source code, and the folder bin contains the compiled binary executable. Under the folder bin, two small matrices, SM10 and M3_4 for testing purpose are also provided. 
The program is written in the C language, and it uses Intel Math Kernel Library. So, in order to compile the source code, one needs to install C compiler, e.g., the Intel C/C++ Compilers, the GNU C Compiler or Visual Studio C Compiler. Additionally, one needs to install Intel MKL.
When C compiler and MKL are available in the system, one can enter the src folder and modify the makefile based on the C compiler and the MKL paths; then type make or nmake to compile. After that, the ocma executable will be generated in the bin folder. 

### Usage

**Eigen-decomposition for Symmetric Matrices** 
```
> ocma eigen disk/memory n A E Q
```
Parameters: 
* disk/memory: Specifies whether using disk or memory. 
* n (input): The row number and column number of matrix A.
* A (input): The filename of the file that stores matrix A. The size of the file should be n*n*sizeof(float).
* E (output): The filename of the file that stores the eigenvalues of matrix A. The file size is n*sizeof(float).
* Q (output): The filename of the file that stores the eigenvectors of matrix A. The file size is n*n*sizeof(float).

**Singular Value Decomposition**
```
> ocma singular disk/memory m n A S U V
```
Parameters: 
* disk/memory: Specifies whether using disk or memory. 
* m (input): The row number of matrix A.
* n (input): The column number of matrix A.
* A (input): The filename of the file that stores matrix A. The size of the file should be m*n*sizeof(float).
* S (output): The filename of the file that stores the singular values of matrix A. The size of the file is min(m,n)*sizeof(float).
* U (output): The filename of the file that stores the left-singular vectors of matrix A. The size of the file is m*min(m,n)*sizeof(float).
* V (output): The filename of the file that stores the right-singular vectors of matrix A. The size of the file is n*min(m,n)*sizeof(float).

**Part Singular Value Decomposition**
```
> ocma singularpart disk/memory m n k A S U V
```
Parameters: 
* disk/memory: Specifies whether using disk or memory. 
* m (input): The row number of matrix A.
* n (input): The column number of matrix A.
* k (input): The number of singular values. k <= min(m,n) is required. 
* A (input): The filename of the file that stores matrix A. The size of the file should be m*n*sizeof(float).
* S (output): The filename of the file that stores the singular values of matrix A. The size of the file is k*sizeof(float).
* U (output): The filename of the file that stores the left-singular vectors of matrix A. The size of the file is m*k*sizeof(float).
* V (output): The filename of the file that stores the right-singular vectors of matrix A. The size of the file is n*k*sizeof(float).

**Matrix Format Conversion**
```
> ocma format txt2bin/bin2txt m n A B
```
Parameters: 
* txt2bin/bin2txt: Specifies to convert text to binary format or in reverse. 
* m (input): The row number of matrix A.
* n (input): The column number of matrix A.
* A (input): The filename of the file that stores matrix A in text/binary format.
* B (output): The filename of the file that stores the matrix in binary/text format.

Note: 
For all file names, the file path must be specified if the file in question is not present in the current working directory.
