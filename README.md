# PRESM

PRESM stands for Personalized Reference Editor for Somatic Mutation discovery. In contrast to other reference genome editor software that generate a diploid reference genome which may distribute the reads to two site, impairing the soundness of the downstream statistical framework, PRESM provides two haploid reference genomes. The pipeline of PRESM involves three steps: First, germline mutations are discovered by another tool, e.g., GATK, and are used to make personalized references to call somatic mutations. Second, a reference genome composed of all personal variants (including both heterozygous and homozygous sites) is used as “decoy” to capture the heterozygous variants in reads. Third, PRESM changes the reads by replacing all heterozygous alleles with the corresponding reference alleles and maps the modified reads back to another personalized reference genome that contains only homozygous changes. The output of this step is a BAM file ready for any somatic mutation callers to use. We intend to offer long-term maintenance for PRESM and continue adding our new functions into it.

### Installation

PRESM is a batteries-included JAR executable; therefore no installation is needed. Please copy the executable presm.jar and run it using the standard command for java package:
java [–Xmx] –jar presm.jar

### Functions
* Processing variants files generated by GATK, Pindel or other variant call software, i.e., combining two variant files that are for SNPs and indels respectively; selecting homozygous variants or heterozygous variants; removing variants with duplicated coordinates.
* Generating the personalized reference genome according to the germline mutations provided by the users. 
* Generating the modified background database files according to personalized reference genomes, for example, the personalized dbSNP, db.Indel, and cosmic.vcf can be generated. (Several downstream somatic mutation callers require these files).
* Mapping the coordinates of somatic variants called by using personalized reference genome to the coordinates of universal
reference genome.
* Replacing the alternative alleles with reference bases according to the heterozygous variants provided by the users.
